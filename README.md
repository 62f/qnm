# qnm
> query node_modules

A simple cli utility for querying the `node_modules` directory.

## Why?
> most bugs are caused by the assumptions we didn't realize we were making.

When debugging a problem, I sometimes find myself checking what are the **realâ„¢** versions of the modules within `node_modules` directory, i want to be able and check a specific module, list them all, get diffs between two repositories etc...

This tool should help me ease and improve this workflow.

## Installation
```bash
npm i --global qnm
```

## Usage
```bash
qnm [module]
```

For example, if you want to see the installed version of `lodash`:
```bash
qnm lodash
```

And you'll see something like that:
```bash
> 4.17.5
> 3.10.1 (cli-table2)
> 3.10.1 (karma)
```

which means you have 3 occurences of lodash in your node_modules:
1. `./node_module/lodash`
2. `./node_module/cli-table2/lodash`
3. `./node_module/karma/lodash`

## Roadmap

* List all node_modules
* Search a module's node_modules
* In case of typo, suggest module name that does exist
* Search by regex
* Fuzzy search for node_modules
* Diff between two workspaces
